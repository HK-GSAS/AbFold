# AbFold

Official repository for [AbFold](): an AlphaFold Based Transfer Learning Model for Accurate Antibody Structure Prediction.

## Installation

All Python dependencies are specified in `environment.yml`. 
We recommend using conda environment, to install dependencies, run:
```bash
$ conda create -n abfold -f environment.yml
$ conda activate abfold
```


## Training

Before training, create `data` folder in project directory and download data to it as following structure:

```
data/
└── abfold/
    └── train/
        ├── unsupervised_repr       # precomputed representations
        ├── unsupervised_fasta      # fasta files
        ├── supervised_label        # label files
        ├── embed                   # embedding files generated by point_mae
        └── unsupervised_embed      # embedding files generated by point_mae for non-structure data
```

To train AbFold model, run:

```bash
$ python train_ema.py
```

## Inference

Before inference, create `data` folder in project directory and download data to it as following structure:

```
data/
└── abfold/
    └── test/
        ├── repr       # precomputed representations
        ├── fasta      # fasta files
        └── embed      # embedding files generated by point_mae
```

To predict Antibody structure with AbFold model, run:

```bash
$ python predict.py
```
